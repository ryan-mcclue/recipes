## Ingredients
    1 tbsp oil I use sunflower oil
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1 large onion peeled and diced
    3 chicken breasts approx. 525g/1.1lbs, chopped into bite-size chunks
    2 tbsp plain (all-purpose) flour
    ¼ tsp salt
    ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
    2 tbsp Hungarian sweet or spiced paprika I use sweet, but use the spicy one if you like a little heat.
    2 cloves garlic - peeled and minced
    400 g (14oz) tin chopped tomatoes in juice
    480 ml (2 cups) hot chicken stock
    225 ml (1 cup) sour cream
## To Serve:
    Cooked pasta - such as pappardelle tagliatelle or penne
    handful of chopped parsley

## Instructions
    1. Heat the 1 tbsp of oil and 2 tbsp of butter in a large pan (on that has a lid), over a medium-high heat.
    2. Add the chopped onion, and cook for 5 minutes, until softened.
    3. Toss the chicken breast pieces together with the 2 tbsp of flour, ¼ tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper.
    4. Add to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, turning the chicken a few times, until lightly browned all over.
    5. Turn the heat down to medium and add in the 2 tbsp of paprika and 2 minced cloves of garlic. Stir together for a minute to coat the chicken.
    6. Add the tin of chopped tomatoes and the 480ml (2 cups) of stock and bring to the boil.
    7. Place a lid on the pan and simmer for 15 minutes.
    8. Remove the lid, give everything as stir and simmer for a further 10 minutes, with the lid off, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.
    9. Turn off the heat and stir through half of the sour cream (about 110ml or ½ a cup).
    10. Serve the chicken paprikash with pasta (it also tastes great with mashed potato!), topped with the rest of the sour cream and a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley. Oh and dont forget a hunk of bread on the side.
