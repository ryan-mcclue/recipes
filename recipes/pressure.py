pressure allows for 120deg water boiling. cooking time 60-75% quicker
ideal pressure is 10-15PSI? (don't waste money on < 10PSI)
have to ensure what we are cooking, e.g. meat, is entirely covered by liquid

for passive (typically get higher PSI)
1. once created enough steam a valve will automatically shut.
2. once pressure indicator is at desired, will hear some hissing.
   it's normal to have steam hissing out at this point
   (with no PSI indicator, when have nice hiss of steam coming out, will know reached)
   may have to adjust stove top heat to get soft hiss
   turn stove down to about 4
3. Once timer elapsed, pressure has to be released to open lid.
   (recipe will typically indicate which option)
   1. Can wait naturally for 15-30minutes.
   2. Can quick release with a button mechanism (may release water, so remove from hot plate)
   3. Run cold water over lid.
      When hear final hiss, know ready.
      (only applicable for stove top ones)

Cooking time of 15minutes is 15minutes after reaches pressure

generally don't brown meat before. if do, will have to add more water
(often water is from ingredients themselves)


CONVERTING:
- there is less evaporation, so more liquid will be there
- cannot cook veg and meat at same time (different densities)
  so, how to handle different cooking times?
- don't add diary or will curdle (same with coconut milk). add at end
  alcohol won't evaporate
