* Always have 1 burner off, so can put meat there to 'coast'
* chrome grate terrible for sustaining heat; use iron grate insert if possible 

* always pre-heat before placing on. TODO: how long to pre-heat for? 30minutes?
  seems pre-heat for a long time then when using have it on low and utilise the built up residual heat?


IMPORTANT: when about to move something if it's too sticky just let it be until it's ready to move
don't commit to a full move before checking

tools: grate cleaner (before use always scrub), long tongs, long spatula

* season with more salt than you normally would
  spray food with oil and then place with tongs on heat
  before turning; spray side with oil then turn

  IMPORTANT: can close lid at start for a few minutes to get 'ambience of heat' 

  IMPORTANT: need to be patient to let food cook; don't remove to early or it'll stick
  (each barbequeue has hotter parts on plates?)

  IMPORTANT: sweet marinades will stick; so think more of as a glaze and only put on one side after turning to set in

  When finished, leave on for a few minutes with lid closed to burn off residual things.
  then rub with cleaning brush. then turn off
