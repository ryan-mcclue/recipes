### Black Pepper Steak:
    450 g (1lb) thin steak , sliced thinly, against the grain (I use sirloin)
    2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
    ¼ tsp salt
    4 tbsp sunflower oil
    1 tsp sesame oil
    2 medium sized onions peeled and chopped into thick slices
    1 green bell pepper deseeded and sliced
    1 red bell pepper deseeded and sliced
    2 tbsp cornflour (cornstarch)
    2 tbsp dark soy sauce
    2 tbsp oyster Sauce
    1 tbsp Chinese rice wine (or replace with dry sherry)
    120 ml (½ cup) beef stock
    2 cloves garlic peeled and minced
    1 tsp minced ginger

## To Serve:
    Boiled rice

## Instructions
    1. Toss the steak slices with 1 tsp of the black pepper and the ¼ tsp of salt.
    2. Heat 3tbsp of the sunflower oil and the 1 tsp of sesame oil in a wok (or large frying pan) over a high heat until hot, then add the steak.
    3. Fry the steak for 2-3 minutes, moving it around the wok so it doesn't stick together, until browned.
    4. Spoon out the steak into a bowl, leaving any oil behind in the wok. Turn down the heat to medium.
    5. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of sunflower oil to the wok. Add in the sliced onions and sliced peppers.
    6. Stir fry the vegetables for 3-4 minutes until starting to soften.
    7. Whilst the vegetables are cooking, take a small jug and add the 2 tbsp of cornflour, 2 tbsp dark soy sauce, 2 tbsp oyster sauce, 1 tbsp Chinese rice wine, 120ml (½ cup) beef stock and the remaining 1 tsp of black pepper. Stir together to combine then put to one side.
    8. Coming back to the wok, add in the 2 minced cloves of garlic and the 1 tsp of minced ginger to the vegetables. Cook for 1 minute, stirring often.
    9. Add in the sauce we mixed in the jug to to the wok and stir together. Let it come to a gentle simmer. If it looks too thick you can add in a splash of water.
    10. Add the steak back to the wok and stir through to coat in the sauce. Cook for a further 2 minutes to heat the steak back through.
    11. Serve the black pepper beef over boiled rice.
