## Ingredients
    45 ml extra virgin olive oil
    25g butter
    1 x onion, finely chopped
    1 x celery stalk, finely chopped
    1 x carrot, finely chopped
    150g pancetta, cubed
    200g minced beef
    200g minced pork
    200 ml red wine
    2 x tablespoons double-concentrated tomato puree
    200 ml stock
    400g tagliatelle - fresh or dried

## Method
    1. Heat the extra virgin olive oil and butter in a pan, add the onion, celery, carrot and pancetta and sweat on a gentle heat for about 10 minutes until the onion has softened.
    2. Add the meat and brown all over.
    3. Increase the heat, add the wine and allow to evaporate.
    4. Dilute the tomato puree in a little of the stock and stir into the meat.
    5. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook on a gentle heat for 2 hours, checking and adding a little extra stock from time to time to avoid the sauce from drying out.
    6. Remove from the heat and serve with freshly cooked tagliatelle.
