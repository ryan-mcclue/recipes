## Massaman Paste - makes about 6 tbsp:
    1 chopped red onion
    3 mild red chillies roughly chopped (or use fewer chillies, depending on how hot you like it) - I use Fresno chillies
    2 tsp ground coriander
    2 tsp cumin
    ½ tsp ground cinnamon
    ½ tsp white pepper
    3 cloves garlic peeled
    2 sticks of lemongrass outer leaves removed, softer inside chopped finely (or replace with 2 tsp lemongrass paste)
    1 tsp minced ginger
    1 tsp shrimp paste optional, also it's generally gluten free, but best to check
    3 tsp fish sauce ,make sure it's a gluten free brand if needed
    1 tsp brown sugar
    small bunch fresh coriander/cilantro stalks you'll be using the leaves later to serve, so just wrap them in a bit of damp tissue to keep them fresh
    ½ tsp salt
## Other curry ingredients:
    2 tbsp vegetable oil
    1.5 tbsp cornflour (cornstarch)
    1 kg (2 ¼ lbs) braising beef (beef chuck) chopped into chunks
    ¼ tsp salt
    ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper
    400 ml (1 ⅔ cups) beef stock - 2 stock cubes with water is fine use kallo beef bouillon cubes for gluten free
    400 g (14 oz) can coconut milk it's usually gluten free, but double check
    500 g (1 lb) baby new potatoes (slice any bigger ones in half)
    Juice of 1 lime
## To Serve:
    Boiled rice
    Chopped fresh coriander (cilantro)
    Chopped red chillies
    Lime wedges

## Instructions
    1. Place all the paste ingredients in a food processor or mini chopper and blend until it forms a paste. Set aside.
    2. Heat the oil in a large pan. Toss the chopped beef in the cornflour, salt and pepper.
    3. Fry the meat in the oil for about 5 mins on medium to high heat. You can do this in batches, but I find that if you put the meat in, and leave it alone for a few minutes before you stir it, you'll get a nice dark colour on the beef. The beef will probably stick a bit to the pan, so you might need to give it a little scrape with a spatula.
    4. Once the beef has cooked for 5 mins, turn down the heat a little and add in the spice paste you made earlier. Give it a stir to coat the beef and let it cook for a couple of minutes.
    5. Add in the beef stock and coconut milk. Give everything a stir (make sure you give any bits stuck at the bottom of the pan a scrape), place the lid on and gently simmer on a low heat for 1 hour 45 mins (alternatively you can place in the oven at about 160C/320F). Give it a stir every so often. If it's starting to look dry you can add in some more beef stock or water.
    6. After the 1 hour 45 mins, add in the potatoes, give it a stir and cook for a further 25 - 30 mins until the potatoes are tender (this is a good time to start cooking your rice too).
    7. Take out of the oven and mix in the lime juice. Serve the curry on a bed of rice with a sprinkling of coriander/cilantro, fresh chillies and a wedge of lime.
