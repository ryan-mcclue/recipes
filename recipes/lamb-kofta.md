## Ingredients
### Lamb Koftas:
    500 g (1.1 lb) lamb mince
    1 tbsp olive oil
    1 small onion (finely diced)
    2 cloves garlic (minced)
    1 tbsp fresh mint (finely chopped)
    2 ½ tsp ground cumin
    2 tsp ground coriander (cilantro)
    ½ tsp chilli flakes (optional)
    ½ tsp salt
    ½ tsp black pepper
    ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
### To Serve:
    4 flatbreads
    1 tbsp fresh coriander (cilantro) roughly chopped
    Salad (I usually use lettuce, tomato and red onion)
    minted yoghurt dip or Tzatziki
### Instructions
    1. Add the 1 tbsp of olive oil to a frying pan (or skillet) and heat over a medium heat.
    2. Add in the finely diced onion and fry for 4-5 minutes stirring occasionally until the onion softens and starts to caramelise.
    3. Add in the 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds stirring continuously.
    4. Place the onion and garlic in a bowl and allow to cool.
    5. In a mixing bowl add the minced lamb and the remaining kofta ingredients along with the cooled onion and garlic mixture.
    6. Mix together until thoroughly combined.
    7. Shape the mixture into koftas on skewers with wet hands (we're using wet hands to help ensure the mixture doesn't stick to you). Squeeze them quite tightly to the skewers (see note 1 and 2).
    8. Cook the koftas on a griddle or BBQ on medium to high heat for around 5-7 minutes, turning 3-4 times during cooking (see note 3). When turning it's a good idea to have a set of tongs handy, as the meat needs a bit of extra support when turning initially - as it's quite delicate.
    9. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for 3-5 minutes before serving.
    10. Serve with some flatbreads, yoghurt dip and a sprinkling of fresh coriander.

## Ingredients
    ½ a large cucumber
    1 cup (240ml) Greek yoghurt (full fat works best)
    1 tsp white wine vinegar
    1 tsp dried dill (or 1 tbsp fresh dill, chopped)
    ½ a small clove of garlic peeled and minced
    ½ tsp sugar (caster/granulated/superfine are all fine)
    1 pinch of salt

## Instructions
    1. Slice the cucumber in half lengthways, and scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon.
    2. Grate the cucumber with a grater, then squeeze all of the liquid out using your hands.
    3. Place the squeezed out cucumber in a bowl and add the rest of the tzatziki ingredients. Mix together, then cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
    4. Optional - if you like you can serve topped with a drizzle of olive oil, a few fresh sprigs of dill and some sliced cucumber.
