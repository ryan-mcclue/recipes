Ingredients:
    1 1/2 pounds Certified Angus Beef Â® ground beef, 80/20 lean
    1/2 cup mayonnaise
    1 tablespoon yellow mustard
    1 tablespoon grated yellow onion
    2 teaspoons hot sauce
    1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
    4 white hamburger buns
    2 tablespoons butter, room temperature
    1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
    1/2 teaspoon pepper
    4 slices American cheese
    2 cups shredded iceburg lettuce
    8 slices vine-ripe tomatoes

Instructions:
    Divide ground beef into 8 equal balls about the size of a ping-pong ball (3-ounces each); refrigerate.
    In a small mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, grated onion, hot sauce and Worcestershire to create a special sauce; refrigerate.
    Using either a large cast iron griddle or 2 large cast iron pans heated to high, toast buns with butter; reserve to plates.
    Space beef balls on hot cooking surface (parchment paper, spatula, meat tenderiser apply pressure downwards to smash as much as possible)
    Season patties with 1-teaspoon of reserved special sauce per patty; salt and pepper. Sear 2-3 minutes or until some fat begins to bubble up in center of patty. Quickly flip and top 4 of the patties with a slice of cheese. Sear another minute and place a plain patty atop a cheese patty; remove from cooking surface.
    Build burgers with a smear of special sauce on bottom bun followed by shredded lettuce, tomato, double burgers and top bun.
