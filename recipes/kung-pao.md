## Marinade:
    2 tbsp rice wine
    ¼ tsp white pepper
    5 tbsp dark soy sauce
    4 tbsp hoisin sauce
    1 tsp sesame oil
    2 tbsp sugar
    2 garlic cloves peeled and minced
    1 thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger peeled and grated
    ½ tsp ground sechuan peppers optional – for those of you who like it hotter

## Remaining Ingredients:
    3 chicken breasts chopped into bite size pieces
    1 tsp cornflour/cornstarch
    1 tbsp vegetable Oil
    8 Dry Whole Chilli Peppers
    2 Red Bell Pepper chopped into squares
    1 medium sized courgette/zucchini chopped into chunks
    12 spring onions/scallions chopped roughly
    ½ cup unsalted peanuts or cashews if you prefer
## To Serve:
    Boiled rice

## Instructions
    1. Mix the marinade ingredients in a bowl.
    2. Place the chopped chicken in a separate bowl and mix with the cornflour/cornstarch,
    3. Then stir in ⅓ of the marinade ingredients into the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes (or up to 12 hours). NOTE: Reserve the remaining ⅔rds of the marinade for the sauce.
    4. Heat your wok or frying pan over a medium heat and add the whole chilli peppers. Dry cook for a couple of minutes – turning regularly until the chillies go darker in colour. NOTE: They burn quite quickly, so keep a close eye on them. Remove from the pan when they’ve darkened and gone a little softer.
    5. Add the oil to your work, heat on a high heat and then add the chicken (using a slotted spoon to remove from the marinade). Fry until cooked through – about 7-8 minutes.
    6. Add in the red peppers, courgette/zucchini and spring onions/scallions. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until heated through, but still crunchy.
    7. Add in the reserved ⅔rds of the marinade and the chillies and cook until the sauce thickens slightly – about 2 minutes.
    8. If you’d prefer the sauce to thicken even more, you can mix a tbsp. of cornflour/cornstarch with a couple of tbsp. of cold water, then pour this mix in whilst stirring. The sauce will thicken very quickly.
    9. Add in the peanuts (or cashews) just before serving, and give them a quick stir. Serve over boiled rice (with a large glass of water if you intend to eat those chillies!)
