To Bake The Pizza:
Stage 1:
1. Once the pizza dough has rested, preheat your oven to its hottest setting.

   Place the dough on the semolina and begin stretching it to your desired shape without pressing the edges.

Dough:
1 kg Flour 35.27oz
650 ml Water 2.7 cups
30 grams Salt 2tbsp
2 grams Fresh yeast 0.03oz. Or ½ teaspoon dry yeast
10 grams Sugar 2.4tsp
25 grams Olive oil 0.88oz
Instructions
1. For this authentic Neapolitan pizza dough recipe, get your mixing bowl, pour in 650ml of water and add 30g salt.
   Mix this well using your hand to help dissolve the salt.
2. Add a handful of flour to the water and mix it through with your hands until the flour dissolves.
   Then add another touch and mix again.
   (should still be liquidy)
3. Next, add the yeast to the mix helping it to quickly melt in the water using your fingers, 
   Mix through with your hand again then add a little flour and continue mixing.
4. The sugar can then be added, mixed through and then add more flour and mix again with one hand, 
   turning the bowl with the other. Continue this process until all of your flour is used.
5. Then, starting at the bottom of the bowl scoop and mix the dough all around the edges, 
   pressing it in gently and still turning the bowl as you work your way around.
   (IMPORTANT: work fast to prevent stickiness)

6. Now add the olive oil and fold it in before covering the bowl with a tea towel/cloth 
   and leaving it to the side (room temperature) for 5-10minutes.
   After max 10 minutes, remove the cloth.
7. Leave the dough in the bowl and start to work it again using the tips of your fingers to fold each side into the middle 
   and then turning the bowl to continue this process all the way around.
   Repeat this a few times until you reach the right consistency then cover with cling wrap 
   and a tea towel on top, making sure there are no gaps for air to get in.
   Leave this in a cool spot in your home for 16hr. 
   After this time it should be well proved and double its original size.
8. Next, put the Neapolitan pizza dough on your bench and start to break off 250g/8.82oz size pieces, 
   making them into your pizza balls.
   (IMPORTANT: ok to put some flour on hands if sticky)
   Place the balls into an air tight container or cover them with a cloth large enough to 
   ensure no air escapes.
   Leave these to prove for an additional 3-4hr at room temperature.
9. Next, sprinkle some flour onto your bench, carefully lift one of the dough balls 
   (you may need a floured utensil to help you) and then transfer it across.
10. Sprinkle a small amount of flour on top of the dough and start to stretch it out.

    Starting an inch from the bottom and working your way an inch from the top, 
    press down using your fingers. 
    Then stop, turn it over and repeat until you have a small round base with a “cornicione” (crust).
11. Gently stretch this by picking up the dough and slightly stretching it onto one forearm then 
    flipping it onto the bench. 
    (slapping it: https://youtu.be/BA-o41np8Tk?t=475)
    Repeat this a few times before shaping it into a circle and then resting it on your bench.

    Then place stone on top rack of oven and change to broil, still at max temperature
