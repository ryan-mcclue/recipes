## Marinade:
    2 tbsp light soy sauce
    2 tbsps dark soy sauce
    2 tbsp oyster sauce
    1 tsp sesame oil
    1 tbsp brown sugar
    1 tbsp rice vinegar
    1 tsp minced ginger
    3 garlic cloves peeled and minced
    1 tbsp Sriracha or other chilli sauce (optional)
    ¼ tsp white pepper
## Stir Fry:
    1.1 lb (500g) Denver or skirt/flank steak, cut into strips (cut against the grain)
    7 oz (200g) uncooked flat rice noodles
    1 tsp sesame oil
    2 ½ tbsp vegetable oil
    ½ a white or brown onion peeled and sliced
    1 yellow bell pepper deseeded and sliced
    2 cups (200g) fresh bean sprouts or 1 can of canned beansprouts, drained
    4 spring onions /scallions, sliced into long, thin strips
    2 cups (60g) fresh baby spinach leaves
## To serve:
    1 red chilli thinly sliced
    1 tbsp sesame seeds (I use a mixture of black and white sesame seeds)

## Instructions
    1. Mix all of the marinade ingredients in a bowl.
    2. Place the sliced beef in a second bowl and add one third of the marinade. Stir together and, cover and leave to marinate for 15-30 minutes. Cover the remaining sauce and put to one side.
    3. Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to pack instructions (usually boil for 5 mins), then drain in a colander and rinse in cold water until completely cold. Toss together with the 1 tsp of sesame oil and leave in the colander until needed.
    4. Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a wok until smoking. Scoop out half of the beef from the bowl and fry on high for 2-3 minutes until just cooked. Remove from the wok and place in clean bowl, then repeat with the remaining beef.
    5. Add the remaining ½ tbsp oil to the wok and fry the onions for 2 minutes.
    6. Add in the yellow pepper and cook for 1 minute, then add in the reserved marinade/sauce and bring to the boil.
    7. Add in the noodles and beansprouts and cook for 3-4 minutes- tossing the noodles every so often (carefully so as not to break them) - until completely heated through.
    8. Add in the beef and cook for a further minute.
    9. At the last minute, stir in the spring onions (scallions) and spinach.
    10. Divide between four plates and serve topped with chilli slices and sesame seeds.
