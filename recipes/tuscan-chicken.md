## For the Chicken
    4 chicken breasts
    1 large egg
    3 tbsp plain all-purpose flour (replace with gluten free flour blend if needed)
    ¼ tsp salt
    ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
    ½ tsp dried oregano
    ½ tsp dried thyme
    ½ tsp paprika
    ¼ tsp garlic salt
    2 tbsp olive oil
## For the Sauce
    1 tbsp olive oil
    1 onion peeled and sliced
    2 cloves garlic peeled and minced
    ½ tsp dried oregano
    1 tsp paprika
    1 cup (160g) sun dried tomatoes I like the bright red one from the deli counter
    1 red bell pepper de-seeded and sliced
    1 tbsp tomato puree (paste)
    ⅓ cup (90ml) white wine
    1 cup (240ml) chicken stock (use bouillon for gluten free)
    pinch of salt and pepper
    ⅓ cup (90ml) double (heavy) cream
    ½ packed cup (50g) parmesan cheese grated
    3 packed cups (90g) fresh baby spinach
    1 tbsp chopped parsley

## Instructions
    1. Preheat the oven to 160C/320F. Trim the chicken breasts to remove any fatty parts.
    2. Whisk the egg lightly in a shallow bowl.
    3. In a separate shallow bowl, mix together the flour, salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, paprika and garlic salt.
    4. Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil in a large frying pan (skillet) on a medium-to-high heat.
    5. Dip the chicken breasts in the egg, then dredge in the flour mixture.
    6. Place the chicken in the pan and fry on both sides until golden.
    7. Take the chicken out of the pan and place on a tray in the oven for 10 minutes to finish cooking whilst you make the sauce.
    8. Add the oil to the pan and heat on a medium heat.
    9. Add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until they start to soften.
    10. Add the garlic, oregano, paprika, sun dried tomatoes, red pepper and tomato puree. Cook for 2 minutes, moving around the pan with a spatula.
    11. Next pour in the wine and allow to bubble for 2 minutes,
    12. Now add the chicken stock, salt and pepper. Bring the boil, then simmer for 5 minutes.
    13. Add the cream, parmesan and the spinach to the sauce and stir and cook for a couple of minutes until the spinach wilts.
    14. Remove the chicken from the oven. Check it's done (insert a knife into the fattest piece of one of the chicken breasts - it should no longer be pink) and place in the pan with the sauce and cook for another couple of minutes.
    15. Serve topped with a sprinkling of fresh parsley. Tastes great with pasta, courgetti (zoodles), rice or saute potatoes.
