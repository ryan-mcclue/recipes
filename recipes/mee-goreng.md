## Ingredients
    2 tbsp vegetable oil
    2 shallots peeled and sliced thinly
    5 mushrooms sliced
    2 cloves garlic minced
    ½ white cabbage thinly sliced
    2 cooked chicken breasts roughly shredded/sliced
    17.5 oz (500g) cooked yellow noodles
    1.5 cups (150g) fresh bean sprouts (mung bean sprouts)
    1 large bunch of spring onions (scallions) chopped into 1 inch (2.5cm) pieces

## For the sauce:
    4 tbsp kecap manis

    ¼ tsp white pepper

## Garnishings:
    2 hard boiled eggs peeled and sliced into halves or quarters
    Small bunch fresh coriander (cilantro) cilantro, roughly torn
    1 red chilli I use mild fresno chillies, sliced
    ¼ tsp chilli flakes

## Instructions
    1. Heat the oil in a large wok until hot. Add the sliced shallots, and fry for a 2-3 minutes until browned. Remove from the work with a slotted spoon and place on kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil.
    2. Turn down the heat to medium and add the mushrooms to the remaining oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes until lightly browned.
    3. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring often.
    4. Add the white cabbage and cook for 3 minutes, until starting to soften.
    5. Add in the chicken and noodles and cook for 3-4 minutes, tossing everything together using a set of tongs, until hot. You can add an extra splash of oil or a splash of water if it’s starting to look a little dry.
    6. Add the beansprouts and spring onions and toss together.
    7. Add the kecap manis, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sweet chilli sauce and white pepper. Toss everything together and cook for a 2-3 minutes until the chicken and noodles are hot throughout.
    8. Serve the mee goreng topped with the fried shallots, wedges of hard boiled egg, fresh coriander (cilantro), sliced chillies, chilli flakes and slices of lime.
